# Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm

## Implemented from scratch using python.

Steps included in this algorithm:
 1) Construct FP tree
 2) Insert FP tree
 3) Mine FP tree recursively
 4) Conditional pattern base
 5) Creating frequent pattern item sets
 
Implementation:
 1) Data preprocessing
 2) Creating and updating FP tree
 3) Mining and creating conditional FP tree
